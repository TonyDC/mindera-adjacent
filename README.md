# Adjacent cells challenge

## Description
This Python script outputs all groups of adjacent cells, given a 2-D matrix consisting of 0 (zeroes) and 1 (ones).

**Assumptions**:
- Cells are considered adjacent if they both contain a 1 (one) and are next to each other horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
- Groups containing a single cell should not be considered
- The order of points or groups outputted by the program is not relevant


## Usage
```py SeqAdjacentCells.py <path to file containing the matrix> <width of the matrix>```
